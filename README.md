# Challenge1-KEY

## Overview and Origin

*       What is the name of the company?
Key
www.lifeatkey.com


*       When was the company incorporated?
The company was incorporated in 2018, but they didn't launch until late 2020.  It was in 2021 where they finally obtained a significant amount of seed money.


*       Who are the founders of the company?
The founders of the company are: Daniel Dubois, Derek Manuge, Rob Richards


*       How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
I believe the idea came out of the USA and Key was one of the first few proptech companies in Canada to jump on this trend and slightly tweak the business model.  The entire idea came about how there is an abundance of people with cashflows sufficient to qualify for a mortgage that do not qualify for one.


*       How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
The company is entirely funded through seed funding.  They received an undisclosed amount from 1 investor in 2021.  In 2022, they received 11M from 10 different investors


## Business Activities

*        What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
The solution they are solving is helping a generation stuck in rentals join the real estate ladder.  


*        Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
The intended customer is first time home buyers that have the cashflow to sustain a mortgage but do not qualify for one.  Key helps renters obtain a mortgage within their three-year plan.  After or during the three years the customer now has built up enough for a down payment, has proven to Grade A lenders that they are reputable enough for a mortgage on their own.
Some common types of these people are: young professionals, new immigrants and self-employed people.

In Canada, according to Amy Ding (CEO of Requity) 40% of Canadians who rent have the ability to sustain a mortgage, which equates to nearly 2 million people. Data from real estate analytics firm Attom Data Solution shows that the number of co-buyers increased by 771% between 2014 and 2021.

The reason the need for this company to exists can be seen from: "According to condominium real estate analysts Urbanation Inc. the average price of a resale condominium reached $707,000 for the first time ever in the third quarter of 2021.The CMHC benchmark down payment of 20 per cent would be over $140,000, and finance experts say it would take the average home-buyer more than 20 years to save up that much money."


*       What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilise?)
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilise?)
I don't personally see what their competitive advantage is over their competition other than getting in at an early stage. One thing that Key does differently than their competitors is specifically deal with condos.  However, they are developing a digital marketplace and some advantages and opportunities could stem from that.

With there being significantly more applicants than houses available.  We can see there is a huge demand for it and the supply hasn’t come in yet.  For these types of companies to be successful it will be paramount for them to be able to convince homeowners and developers to use their company to sell their house/ units.  Specifically with Key it will be absolutely important for them to get in tight with developers, even more so because they deal in condos in metropolises. 


*       Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.)
According to BuiltWith, Key is using 51 different technologies.

They are using software to vet applicants.
They Are using Hubspot to access contact info
They are using social media and online articles for advertising
Woocommerce is used for their online presence 


## Landscape

*       What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Key, is in the real estate tech space aka proptech.  Key is specifically in the co-ownership part of this domain.


*        What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5–10 years?
Around 15 years ago we started to see crowdfunding for homes enter this market, think of VRBO and Air BNB.  Since then, other domains in the real-estate fintech space have emerged such as:
-Lending: ex. Pineapple, Perch
-Property valuation
-Buying fractional ownership ex. Willow
-Tech driven real estate brokers ex. Properly
-Property management software


*        What are the other major companies in this domain?
Zillow, Air BNB, Divvy.  Due to this being a relatively new industry and relatively low barriers to entry, there is an abundance of new upcoming players vying for this space.

From what I can see there are 3 Canadian companies that compete in the coownership long term space that seeks to help enters join the real estate game: Requity, Ourboro and Key.


## Results

*       What has been the business impact of this company so far?
49 people now own homes with Key


*       What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
Some of the metrics these companies could measure success other than financial include:
-People helped (renters converted)
-Average duration of the rental term
-Do the renters end up becoming homeowners or do they go back to renting.
-Client Satisfaction


*       How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
- Key has helped less than both other companies.

This is hard to measure as these companies are all within 0-4 years of starting. Other than people helped the other stats are more intangible and stats online aren’t readily available.


## Recommendations

*       If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your       imagination!)
Keep on approaching condo developers, I think this is the best way to acquire multiple units at once.  Key should be playing up the angle of helping generations stuck in rent get out as opposed to selling units to people as there secondary homes/ rental income assets.  The number 1 priority right now will be acquiring more units.

Breaking into the USA is another great idea to as the market is bigger and eventually it will be needed to expand.  I wouldn't be solely focused on certain cities as opposed to getting in with a developer and wherever there new buildings are go with it.

Potentially look into funding from the Government for grants and tax breaks as the service provided should help with the housing crisis.

Keep your technologies up to date, but I dont see much value in innovating them.
